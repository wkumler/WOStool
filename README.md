# WOStool

I'd like to have an easier way to access Web Of Science data than via their website. My goal with this project is to ping the Web Of Science API (wihtout authentication, unless UC Berkeley has a system in place already) and perform searches for individual authors. I'd then like to create a word cloud with their titles (maybe abstracts too?) and produce a local network with the other authors that show up in their works.
